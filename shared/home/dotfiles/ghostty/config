# Ghostty configuration
#
# This is the default Ghostty configuration.
# Read more about configuring Ghostty here:
# https://ghostty.org/docs/config

# In order to support different settings per
# platform, we can conditionally load the
# following configuration files based on whether
# or not it is present.
# 
# We want this because some settings, like
# `font-size` appear differently even with the
# same value across different platforms.
# 
# Read more about splitting between different
# files here:
